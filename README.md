# Dungeons and Developers 
**1v1 Game Designer & Developer**

## Project: 1v1 Gamemode  
- Navigate a procedurally‑generated maze.  
- Defeat monsters using Python coding challenges.  
- Compete against one other player.  
- Reach the exit first to win!  
- Simple code commands to traverse the maze.  
- Opponent’s position updates in real‑time.  
- Robust code interface with syntax highlighting and detailed feedback.  
- Competitive integrity ensured by identical mazes and initial questions.  
- Players get stunned for incorrect submissions or hitting a wall.

## Architecture  

### Server  
- Hosts a single game at a time.  
- Handles network connections, maze and monster generation, and position synchronizations.  
- Automatically resets itself after the game ends.  

### Client  
- Handles maze movement, animations, and music.  
- Submits code to the backend for running and testing.  
- Sends updated position to the opponent.  

## Research Findings  
Overall, results were very promising. The Value, Engagement, and Reward metrics recorded the highest mean scores of 4.62, 4.62, and 4.59 respectively — indicating students found the experience highly fulfilling.  
Perceived Usability had the lowest mean score of 3.76, suggesting an area for future improvement (potentially addressing a few technical issues or confusion around initial game mechanics).  
Participants reported having higher motivation to solve programming problems in the game than in traditional assignments, thereby affirming the game’s core educational goal.

### 1v1 Mode Survey Results  
| UES Metric           | Average Score |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Focused Attention     | 3.94         |
| Perceived Usability   | 3.76         |
| Aesthetics            | 4.28         |
| Reward                | 4.59         |
| Learning              | 4.50         |
| Motivation            | 4.55         |

### User‑suggested Improvements  
- Shorten move commands for faster gameplay.  
- Add real‑time error checking to the coding interface for immediate feedback.  
- Increase complexity of the maze and add more monsters for continued challenge.
